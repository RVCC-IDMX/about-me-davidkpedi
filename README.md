# My about me 

My name is David kpedi,
This project is about a young upcoming street wear brand trying to create a legacy on how he views the world through a visual representation of gorilla art on a piece of fabric or on a plain canvas. the gorilla art represents the struggles we face in this world even as humans, while the word(stubbborn) represents us as humans keeping a strong mentality of not giving up no matter the difficulties we face in life, we always get that surge to keep pushing and never giving up.
